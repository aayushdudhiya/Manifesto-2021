As I sit, obseving the horde of inebriated young socialites driven by temptations, I take pleasure in knowing that, while a part of me flourishes in such an environment, my personal aspirations will not often lead me to such crassness. The privilage of youth, the absence of responsibility, the free spirited nature of song and dance...all fleeting.. I feel it. The venom of adulthood slowly sinks its way through my veins, and with it, comes new passions, new habits. I do enjoy it. but I cannot deny the inevitable ending of an era.
